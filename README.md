# TechChassis_Project
Developed TechChassis, an advanced autonomous navigation robot engineered using ROS2 Humble, Gazebo, and RViz2 to achieve precise, reliable, and adaptive motion in dynamic environments. Designed a complete navigation stack including mapping, localization, path planning, and motion control, supported by a robust sensor-fusion pipeline that integrates LiDAR, IMU, and wheel encoder data for high-accuracy trajectory tracking and drift reduction. Validated all behaviors through high-fidelity simulations, ensuring smooth obstacle avoidance, stable load handling, and consistent performance under varying conditions. Additionally, created the mechanical chassis in Fusion 360 and prototyped embedded-control workflows using STM32CubeIDE and Arduino IDE, laying the groundwork for real-world hardware deployment and future system scaling.
